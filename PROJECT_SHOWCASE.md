# Project Showcase

This file highlights the strongest projects discovered on this machine and how to present them.

## Primary Portfolio Repository

- Path: `C:\Users\alvin\TEst\introtodeeplearning`
- Purpose: interview-ready showcase combining app engineering and AI/deep-learning artifacts
- Best talking points:
  - Flask product with structured lessons and code execution
  - Test coverage with route and feature checks
  - Documentation and deployment-style artifacts

## Additional Repositories Found

1. `C:\Users\alvin\MyProjects\Deep-Learning\nanoGPT`
Reason to mention: demonstrates exposure to modern LLM training code and model workflows.

2. `C:\Users\alvin\Documents\GitHub\Data-Science-For-Beginners`
Reason to mention: structured curriculum and broad data science foundations.

3. `C:\Users\alvin\MyProjects\Python-Learning\ACA\deep-learning`
Reason to mention: earlier deep-learning course implementation work.

## Recommended Public Positioning

- Lead with `ACA Learning Platform` as the main project.
- Add one short section called `Deep Learning Labs` that links to the notebooks.
- Mention `nanoGPT` as learning/research context, not as original authored product.

## Resume Bullet Bank

- Built a Flask learning platform with lesson routing, interactive code execution, and progress tracking.
- Added integration-style test coverage to validate route behavior and execution endpoints.
- Produced clear technical documentation and project artifacts for reviewer onboarding.
- Applied Python automation and troubleshooting practices to improve reliability and maintainability.
