# Portfolio Assets

## Resume Project Entry
ACA Learning Platform | Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Testing
- Built an interactive Python learning platform with structured lesson paths, in-browser code execution, and learner progress tracking.
- Implemented robust server-side execution flow with error handling and response formatting for user-submitted code.
- Added integration-style tests with Flask's test client to validate routes, lesson rendering, and code execution behavior.
- Packaged deep learning coursework and ACA policy artifacts into a documented, interview-ready repository.

## 30-Second Interview Pitch
I treated this as an engineering product, not just coursework. I built a Flask-based learning platform that serves structured lessons, executes code safely on the backend, and tracks learner progress. Then I added route-level and feature-level validation using Flask's test client and documented the architecture so reviewers can assess tradeoffs quickly. It demonstrates full-stack ownership and practical AI-adjacent engineering.

## LinkedIn Project Blurb
Built a portfolio-ready Python learning platform from my Intro to Deep Learning work. The app uses Flask + JavaScript for interactive lessons and backend code execution, includes progress tracking, and is backed by feature tests for reliability. This project demonstrates end-to-end product engineering from concept to tested delivery.
